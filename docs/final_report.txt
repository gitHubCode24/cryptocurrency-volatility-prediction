
CRYPTOCURRENCY VOLATILITY PREDICTION - FINAL REPORT
==================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict cryptocurrency volatility
using historical price, volume, and market capitalization data.

METHODOLOGY:
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handled missing values using forward fill
   - Engineered 19 technical features including moving averages, RSI, Bollinger Bands
   - Normalized features using StandardScaler

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Price-based features: price_change, high_low_ratio, open_close_ratio
   - Volatility features: 7-day and 30-day rolling volatility
   - Technical indicators: RSI, Bollinger Bands, ATR
   - Volume features: volume ratios and liquidity ratios

3. Model Selection:
   - Tested 6 different algorithms: Linear Regression, Ridge, Random Forest, 
     Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning for best performing models
   - Used time-series aware validation

DEPLOYMENT:
The best performing model has been deployed using Flask API with a web interface
for real-time volatility predictions.

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Volatility is highly correlated with volume and price movements
- Technical indicators provide significant predictive power
- Ensemble methods (XGBoost, Random Forest) generally outperform linear models
- Feature engineering is crucial for model performance

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Implement deep learning models (LSTM, GRU) for time-series patterns
- Add more sophisticated technical indicators
- Include external factors (news sentiment, market events)
- Implement real-time data pipeline for live predictions
